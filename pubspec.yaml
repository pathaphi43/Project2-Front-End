publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - images/homelogo.png
      - images/home.jpg
      - images/ud.jpg
      - images/fr.jpg
      # - Json/photo.json
#      - Json/thai_provinces.json
      - images/back.jpg
      - images/nong.jpg
      - img/logo.png
      - img/biglogo.png
      - img/PEAlogo.png
      - img/PWAlogo.png
      - img/PEApay.jpg
      - img/rentpay.png
      - img/PWApay.jpg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Roboto-Thin.ttf
        - asset: font/Roboto-Bold.ttf

    - family: Kanit
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Kanit-ExtraLight.ttf

    - family: FredokaOne-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: font/FredokaOne-Regular.ttf

    - family: Righteous-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Righteous-Regular.ttf

    - family: imgIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Water_dop.ttf
        - asset: font/Light_wip.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
